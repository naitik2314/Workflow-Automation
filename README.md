# Workflow-Automation
I am an Youtuber, like sort of, I don't have Subscribers in double digit, but I am trying, so my workflow includes Twitter and Instagram, like whenever I post a video, I add a post on instagram about new video, and a tweet on Twitter, but this monotonous, and anything monotonous has to be automated, so in this project, my YouTube channel is always checked for new content, and as soon as new content is posted, the title and thumbnail are taken, and posted on Instagram and Twitter.
